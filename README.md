Business Objectives: 
With rental properties booming in The Gambia and 3rd party companies having much of the control over marketing privately owned accommodation. It has come to my attention that the benefit of handling your own bookings and web application allows the user/potential guests the ability to have a secure and accesible form of booking that is direct with the property.. This benefits both the owner and users as it removes any 3rd party services/charges and allows us to create a safe and secure environment for our user. 
This inturn offers trust to the user and a straightforward approach to bookings including the options to cancel and to amend bookings. 

Scope:
